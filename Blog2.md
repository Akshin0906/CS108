## -Over/Under 

In Over/Under, two teams take turns selecting a card and posing a numerical question. The other players then must come to a conclusion regarding the answer. The player who chose the card must then guess whether the answer is higher or lower than the number given. If the guess is correct, they can keep the card and the turn passes to the next team.

## -Fluxx 

Fluxx is a card game that is perfect for any type of gathering and requires 2 or more players. It is easy to learn and offers endless possibilities and strategies, making each game unique and different. Players draw and play cards which can change the rules and goals of the game. The object of the game is to match the Keeper cards with the current Goal card in order to win. There are four types of cards: Action, Keeper, Goal, and Rule. Each turn, a player draws a card and plays a card, changing the rules and goals of the game.


Our group of five players began the game with a few basic rules. However, it didn't take long for things to change as we started playing with Action, Rule, Keeper, and Goal cards. The Action cards enabled us to perform actions such as drawing extra cards or swapping Keepers with other players. The Rule cards modified the rules of the game, making it more exciting. The Keeper cards gave us a way to set up for victory, and the Goal cards showed us the conditions for winning.


# Fluxx Session Report


This session of Fluxx was played between four players: myself, Aneesh, Sai and Krajna. The game began with the Basic Rules card and the Draw 1, Play 1 Rule card. We all drew our starting hands of 3 cards each.

The first round was led by myself, starting with an Action card, 'Take an Extra Turn'. I played this card, allowing me to draw and play two cards. I then used a Creeper card 'Zombies' to give myself and the other players a handicap of -1 card each. Aneesh then played an Action card, 'Swap Hands', allowing everyone to switch their hands.

At this point, Sai played a Goal card, 'Robots & Aliens'. Krajna then played an Action card, 'Draw 3, Play 2', allowing everyone to draw 3 cards and play 2 cards. We then all drew our cards and began to plot our strategies.

I played a Keeper card, 'Cats', followed by Aneesh playing an Action card, 'Take Another Turn'. We followed this up with Sai playing a Keeper card, 'Robots', and Krajna playing a Keeper card, 'Aliens'. After a few more turns, Sai was able to get the winning goal pair of 'Robots & Aliens', securing the victory
