# First Playable

## Crystal Caverns 

Our game is a 2-D platformer called Crystal Caverns. The player takes on the role of an adventurous explorer who must traverse through a series of underground caves. The objective of the game is to survive in a collapsing cave as long as possible while collecting falling crystals. The player will be able to move left and right to avoid falling boulders. The crystals will count toward their final score. The player will have to work against the clock, as the cavern is unstable and will collapse within a specified amount of time. The game will feature multiple levels, each with its own unique maps and levels to the cavern. The levels will become increasingly difficult as the player progresses. The game will also have a scoring system that keeps track of the player's performance.

## My Role

My role is the coder for the game. I am tasked with using Unity and C# to flesh out the game from the inside, while my artist works on the exterior of our product. I have had to pick up a lot of new skills, but it has been an amazing learning experience. 

## Playtests

1) Players responded very favorably to our game, while they acknowledged it had some work to do. The state of our game that was presented was in a very rough form, but the playtesters all agreed that when polished the overall gameplay would be very fun and addicting.

2) The number one thing I plan to focus on is to fix the collisions between the crystals and the player, so that the game can actually work as intended. Beyond that I expect to just expand by adding more levels and perhaps a timer along with a scoreboard.
