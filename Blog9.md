The most important thing I learned from this class would definitely be game development skills, specifically Unity. Having to learn untiy for designing and creating our first game was an amazing experience for me personally. As I am a software engineer, I love picking up and learning new coding languages or frameworks. Learning Unity came with its own quirks and features which I had lots of fun learning. Another great topic I learned about was the Mechanics Dynamics Aesthetics framework. This gave me insight into how games are modelled and what different thought goes into mapping out how a game will turn out. 

All of the material seemed connected, starting from the concept of "games" like board games and then working our way into video games, everything felt like it followed a logical progression. Side note, the board game portion of class was very fun too, I've never been put in a position to develop a board game and test other's and it was a lot of fun. 

Looking back at the course, it's clear that the practical learning method applied in the study of game development was exceptionally useful. The collaborative sessions of board game creation and playtesting allowed us to understand the role of user feedback and the importance of teamwork. Also, providing weekly discussions on new topics helped bring the class together and promoted a healthy dialogue about the information we were learning.
