## 1) Write about your experience playing, what happened during play?
I had a great experience playing Tetris on the emulator. Tetris was a game I played a lot back almost 15 years ago on my Nintendo DS. The game was just as fun as I remember it from my childhood days. I found the graphics to be much worse, as it is emulating the original Tetris from 1988, but the music was just as catchy as it was on my DS in 2008. 
The controls were very responsive, surprisingly. I had no idea an emulator could have ported it to keyboard controls that well. I got hooked onto it for a couple rounds, trying to set a high score each time! 

Overall, playing Tetris on an emulator was an enjoyable experience. It brought back memories of my childhood and it was great to revisit such a classic game. It was a great reminder of why Tetris is still so popular after all these years.

## 2) How is it different playing on an emulator vs playing the game on the original hardware or an arcade cabinet?
Despite the great feel of the emulator I feel that it will never match the feel of a true arcade setup. This is because of the joystick controls being much more intuitive, along with the immersive sound system. This isn't even mentioning the massive screen, leading to a fully immersive experience for the user. The clicky feel of the buttons on an arcade also isn't quite replicated by that of a laptop.
