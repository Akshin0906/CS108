# First Playable

## Crystal Caverns 

Our game is a 2-D platformer called Crystal Caverns. The player takes on the role of an adventurous explorer who must traverse through a series of underground caves. The objective of the game is to survive in a collapsing cave as long as possible while collecting falling crystals. The player will be able to move left and right to avoid falling boulders. The crystals will count toward their final score. The player will have to work against the clock, as the cavern is unstable and will collapse within a specified amount of time. The game will have a scoring system that keeps track of the player's performance.

## How To Play

Our game has very straight forward 2D gameplay. Using the arrow keys on your keyboard(Or A and D), you can move your character side to side while attempting to dodge falling boulders and catching crystals. 

Note: When the game ends after you get hit with a falling boulder, it will pause the game. Press spacebar to replay. Doing so will also reset your score.

# Current State of Game

Compared to our Alpha, the game is in a much better place. Initially I was having a lot of trouble with hit detection, and was unable to have the boulders or crystals register as hits. I also was having trouble setting up the scoring system. Now that all of that is fully functional, all that remains is to polish the game up from an aesthetics standpoint. I will spend the remaining few days before submission doing that with my partner.
