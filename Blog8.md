The gaming industry has witnessed significant growth in recent years, thanks to innovative games that have captured players' attention. Among these popular games are Gacha games and those with collectibles, which have proven to be a lucrative venture for game developers. This presentation explores the impact of money on these games and the gaming industry as a whole.

Starting with a captivating story of a man who spent over $70,000 on a Gacha game, we'll delve into the addictive nature of these games. Players spend money on in-game items that enhance their gameplay or improve their social standing.

Our exploration of Gacha games and collectibles delves into gaming revenue history and the largest Gacha game today, Genshin Impact. We examine the currencies in these games, such as signups and battle passes, and the vast array of purchasable items.

We also explore the psychological side of these games, including concepts like loss aversion and the anchoring effect, which keep players engaged and spending money. We gain insights into the future of gaming revenue and its impact on the industry.

We'll showcase a video of a CEO explaining the strategies used to generate revenue from free-to-play games, providing further insight into these tactics.

This presentation offers an engaging and informative discussion on how Gacha games and collectibles are shaping the gaming industry, with the goal of helping attendees understand the topic fully. We've conducted extensive research on this subject, and we look forward to presenting our findings.
