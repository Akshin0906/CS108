Unfortunately I wasn't able to make it to class due to sickness to play in class, however I played it myself at home and had a unique experience with these games. However, I didn't want to miss the fun, so I decided to give the games a try by myself at home. It was an interesting experience exploring the mechanics of the games and imagining how they would have been playing with a group.

Two of the games that caught my attention were Quiplash and Fibbage. Quiplash is a party game where players answer prompts with witty responses, and then everyone votes on their favorite response. Though I played alone, I could see the potential for humor and creativity when playing with a group. I imagined my classmates coming up with hilarious answers, making the game a fun way to get to know each other's sense of humor and competitive spirit.

Fibbage, on the other hand, is a trivia game where players try to deceive one another with convincing lies while simultaneously identifying the truth from a list of answers. Playing solo, I focused on learning the mechanics and understanding how to craft believable lies. I could picture the game becoming quite challenging and engaging when played with others, as we would all try to outwit each other while deciphering the truth.

Although playing Jack Box games alone was a different experience compared to playing with a group, it gave me a solid understanding of the game mechanics and allowed me to appreciate the potential for fun when played with friends or classmates. I look forward to having the opportunity to join my classmates in the future for a lively session of Jack Box games, where we can all share laughter, competition, and camaraderie.
