## Description

My game is centered around a square board with different piece landing tiles. The players start at the "Start" tile and continue through the square board in a clockwise fashion. The goal of the game is to roll the die on your turn and continue through the board and collect points. Points will be obtained through the different tasks the player is given when they land on a tile. Once a player reaches 15 points they will have won the game. If a player exceeds 15 points on a turn, they are reset to 10. This is why the "abilities" are useful. They add a level of strategy regarding when to burn points to move back or forward a square.

Landing Tiles:

White: Whatever you roll you gain in points

Dotted: Flip a coin, whoever gets heads first takes any number of points from the other player

Yellow: Whoever gets a six first from rolling a die wins 3 points

Green stripe: Get one point

## Play Log

Version 1: 
Player 1 rolls the die and lands on a white tile, gaining 5 points.
Player 2 rolls the die and lands on a dotted tile. Player 1 flips a coin and gets heads, gaining 3 points from Player 2.

Player 1 rolls the die and lands on a yellow tile. Player 1 rolls a six and wins 3 points.
Player 2 rolls the die and lands on a dotted tile. Player 2 flips a coin and gets heads, taking 2 points from Player 1.

Player 1 rolls the die and lands on a green stripe tile, gaining 1 point.
Player 2 rolls the die and lands on a white tile, gaining 4 points.

Player 1 rolls the die and lands on a yellow tile. Player 1 rolls a four and does not win any points.
Player 2 has 10 points and rolls the die. Player 2 lands on a dotted tile and flips a coin. Player 2 gets heads, taking 3 points from Player 1.

Player 1 rolls a 4 and lands on white, getting to 15 points and winning the game.

This version does not have abilities, it is purely a game of the landing tiles. I decided to add the abilities to add a different dimension into the game and have the game be more strategic in the way the player utilizes their points. 



Version 2:
Player 1 rolls a 6, lands on a white tile and gains 6 points.
Player 2 rolls a 5, lands on a green stripe tile and gains 1 point.

Player 1 rolls a 4, lands on a dotted tile and wins the coin flip, taking 4 points from Player 2.
Player 2 rolls a 6, lands on a yellow tile and wins 3 points.

Player 1 rolls a 6, lands on a white tile and gains 5 points. Player 1 now has 16 points, exceeding the 15 points needed to win the game. Player 1's score is reset to 10 points.
Player 2 rolls a 3, lands on a green stripe tile and decided to use an ability to move forward one tile. The tile is white so the player gets 3 points.

Player 1 rolls a 3, lands on a dotted tile and wins the coin flip, taking 4 points from Player 2.
Player 2 rolls a 6, lands on a yellow tile and wins 3 points.

Player 1 rolls a 3 and lands on a green striped square, winning 1 point and winning the game.

This version included the abilities and I feel like it worked far better with it. It added a layer of strategy and complexity that was missing before. By this point I felt that the game was pretty much complete so I did not need to modify it any further. 


## Conclusion
The core mechanic of this game is dice rolling. Players take turns rolling the die in order to move through the board, collecting points and encountering different tasks along the way. Rolling the die is the fundamental action of the game and determines how far a player can move on their turn. The results of the dice roll are determined by the number of faces on the die, which will vary depending on the game being played. 

The game board is a square with different types of tiles. The start tile is where players begin the game and the end tile is where the game ends. Abilities allow players to use their points to move back or forward a square. Landing tiles give players different outcomes when they land on them. Players take turns rolling the die and moving around the board. If the roll is a 6, the player can move to any tile on the board and choose the task they wish to complete. If the roll is a 1, the player must move one square only and complete the task on that tile. If the roll is a 2, 3, 4, or 5, the player must move in a clockwise direction the same number of squares as the roll. Players continue to move around the board, collecting points and completing tasks until one of them reaches 15 points. 

Dice rolling is the main mechanic of this game and it is what makes the game exciting and unpredictable. Players must be strategic when rolling the die and managing their points in order to win the game. The game can be modified to include different types of dice with different numbers of faces, allowing for more variety and a different level of difficulty. In my opinion this game is an exciting way to play with friends and can easily provide hours of entertainment as a laid back game.
