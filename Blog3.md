## Description

My game is centered around a square board with different piece landing tiles. The players start at the "Start" tile and continue through the square board in a clockwise fashion. The goal of the game is to roll the die on your turn and continue through the board and collect points. Points will be obtained through the different tasks the player is given when they land on a tile. Once a player reaches 15 points they will have won the game. If a player exceeds 15 points on a turn, they are reset to 10. This is why the "abilities" are useful. They add a level of strategy regarding when to burn points to move back or forward a square.

Landing Tiles:

White: Whatever you roll you gain in points

Dotted: Flip a coin, whoever gets heads first takes any number of points from the other player

Yellow: Whoever gets a six first from rolling a die wins 3 points

Green stripe: Get one point
